Sonny Bayes
===============You are a train robber named Sonny Bayes. You have an informant inside the central 
bank who alerts you there are three trains leaving the bank on a certain day carrying 
large and equal amounts of gold to the three regional banks. You and your buddies 
Buster and Shane will help you rob the trains. 

The three of you agree that robbing a train is a three person job and that you'll only 
be able to rob one of them. You know this because this is your 5th attempt. Each time
before each of you were able to get onboard each of the trains, and count the gold 
but were never able to figure out how to get if off the train. But now you have devised
a clever scheme but it will involve all of you working together robbing the same train. 

The day of departure, your informant sends you a message saying that one of the trains 
left as scheduled but before the second left they discovered that the thrid train had 
broken down. So they moved all the gold from this third train to the second and sent 
the second train along. The message however did not mention which of the regional banks 
the trains were sent too. You know one has twice as much gold but don't know which is 
which. After some discussion, you all agree that you might as well pick one at random and 
get to it. 

You sneak onto the train and find your way to the treasury car. To your great excitement
you find what appears to be around 10 million dollars worth of gold. It's not the most 
have have seen on a train but is still more than you had hoped. As you begin loading 
it up, Buster says "You know, it isn't too late to just leave this and go rob the 
other train. If we're lucky we might find twice as much on the other train." 

Shane frowns and replies, "Yeah and if we are unlucky we'll only find half as much". 

Buster apears to concede and you all go back to packing up your gold. But then Buster 
suddenly stops and turns to both of you excitedly. "We picked this train randomly right? 
That means there is a 50-50 chance that this train is the richer one, right?"

You both nod in agreement wondering where he is going with this. Then he say, "It seems
to me that we are better off swicthing. Odds are we are going to come out ahead. If we
keep this gold, we might have 10 million but if we swicth we either get 5 million or 20 
million, right? Since either is equally likely, it seems to me that on average we 
are going to make (5+20)/2. That's 12 and a half which is more than 10."

You and Shane, being less schooled in arithmetic than Buster, discuss it a bit but 
can't see anything wrong with the argument. So you unpack the gold and get ready to jump
off the train when Shane speaks up. "This just doesn't seem right. Buster's arithmetic
seems right but wouldn't this hold no matter how much we found. Isn't half of anything
plus twice of that same thing always greater than the original thing. They scrawl down
examples for a few different numbers and find that it always seems to work out the same. 
(If they knew algebra, they would express this as (x/2+2x)/2 = 5/4 x > x. 

Then Shane says something that confuses all of you. He says, "If it works for every number
then why did we even have to count the gold. Wouldn't it also be better to switch even
if we didn't even count it? Why did we even have to climb on board? Couldn't we have 
just rode up next to the train and decided to switch right then or even not even ride up
next to this train? How could randomnly picking one train and then immediately changing
your mind make you come out ahead? When we ride up next to this next train, can't we make 
the same argument that switching is better and so should come back to this one?"

At this point Buster is exasperated and yells at Sonny that he is not going to just let
that extra few million get away from him. He and Buster both draw their revolvers and aim
at each other. You, Sonny Bayes, are the gang leader. You gotta straighten this out, 
decide what to do and convince your two partners. Should you switch or not and why?
