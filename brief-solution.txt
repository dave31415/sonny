Though Buster's logic is incorrect, he is right that they should switch and rob the other 
train. The important piece of evidence that they are all ignoring is the fact
that they have useful prior information from their three previous robbery attempts. The
average value they have seen in the past is 11.1 million in gold with a standard deviation 
of about 3. We can use this information to make the right decision. 

If they have picked the right train on their first guess, the amount
planned for each train was 5 million and so they are seeing 10 million on this train. If they
have not picked the right train, it means that the original value was 10 million and so the other
train now has 20 million. So the original value is either 5 or 10. 

Which is more likely? Well, both 5 and 10 are less than the past average of 11.2 but 10 is 
certainly closer. The least amount they had seen before is 7; 5 is about 2 standard deviations
below the mean. So, it seems that the original amount being 5 would be the less likely scenario. 
It is more likely that it was 10 and that the other train now has 20. 

What would true professionals do? They would know in advance what the cut-off value 
should be when they count the gold on the first train and if it is less than that value, they
should switch trains immediately. What is the cut-off value? You might think that it is 11.1 but that 
actually isn't correct. In fact, it requires a few more assumptions about the form of the
prior distribution and the use of Bayesian statistics. If we assume it is a normal distribution, 
you can show that the cut-off value is 4/3 times the mean of 11.1 or 14.8 and that switching will
be the right choice about 80% of the time. The full solution is posted here.

Congrats to our best train robbers for coming to the right conclusion.
